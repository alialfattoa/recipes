    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish of an oven-baked, flat, leavened dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese,
         and various other ingredients, like meat, vegetables, or herbs. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 small garlic cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Cornmeal, for stretching the dough</li>
        <li>1 pound Pizza Dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, torn or thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
         You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
         <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.
             Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
             The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.
             Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
