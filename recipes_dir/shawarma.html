    <p>Shawarma is a Middle Eastern street food made of marinated, slow-roasted meat
         that is shaved from a vertical rotisserie and served in a wrap or as a platter.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp allspice</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp cardamom</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp clove</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinade chicken – Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag.
             Add the chicken, seal, the massage from the outside with your hands to make sure each piece is coated.
              Marinate 24 hours (minimum 3 hours).</li>
        
        <li>Preheat stove or BBQ – Heat a large non-stick skillet with 1 tablespoon over medium high heat,
             or lightly brush a BBQ hotplate/grills with oil and heat to medium high. (See notes for baking)</li>

        <li>Cook chicken – Place chicken in the skillet or on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred.
             Turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time).</li>

        <li>To make a wrap, get a piece of flatbread and smear with Garlic Sauce. Top with a bit of pickles and Chicken Shawarma. Roll up and enjoy!</li>
